# GTPS3
Growtopia Private Server GTPS3 (Lastest Source he just scammed 750$)

Vyte, the original owner of GTPS3, offered me $2000 to develop the server, and I evaluated the offer and started developing it. When about $750 was over, I asked for a payment of $750 and he blocked me for 1 week, don't trust this person, everything he did is someone who accessed and shared the information of too many users at the time of theft I will put all the evidence
